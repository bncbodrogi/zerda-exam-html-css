        position: absolute;
        background: blue;
      }
      .bar {
        top: 20px;
        left: 20px;
        width: 30px;
        height: 30px;
        position: absolute;
        background: yellow;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="foo">
      <div class="bar"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
#### Your answer: [2p]
The yellow boxes top left corner is 40px from the top and 40px from the left of the document body as there is 20px positioning set in each divs and there is no additional margin or padding on top of that.

## 3. Explain concepts (~15 minutes) [4 points]
Add your answer to this readme file, commit your changes to this repository.


### Explain the difference between `display: block` and `display: inline` in CSS! What is `display: inline-block`?
#### Your answer: [2p]

The main difference between them is the way the elements with the specified property are rendered. A block for example will take a whole line, so two blocks will be placed below each other. Inline-block is like a hybrid between the two, so in terms of positioning you can put two inline-blocks beside each other in one line, but the default spacing (margins and padding) will resemble the block property.

### What is the difference between a `<section>` and an `<article>` element? Name one good example of using an `<article>`.
#### Your answer: [2p]

An article makse sense on its own, it is an individual self defining part of the site, it is more important, has more weigth than a section. Both are very similar in terms of default style, but the article is the one with the spot light on, a section is more like the John Snow of the Stark family (in the first season)
need to be decribed as something or something else, needs to have a heading or a label.
